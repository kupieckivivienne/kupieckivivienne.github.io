Hello everyone! 
Welcome to my final project. 

My intention for creating this project was to broadcast my video editing projects through the years and create a space where I could see them all come together. 
My website tracks my progress as an editor and demonstrate the progress I have made over the years. I wanted to create this site in order to attract other video
editiors, or even individuals who are interested in using editing software to see my work and become inspired. I hope that my project will encourage other creators 
to interact with my question page, and hopfully generate comission or tutorial opportunities for aspiring editors alike. 

A couple of things that I had difficulty with: 
--> site layout: it was sometimes difficult to figure out what CSS elements to use and how to use them correctly. 
--> implementing the correct navigation links: I would have to look at each page and correctly adjust the relative paths to make them work correctly. 

I hope you enjoy taking a look at my site, and please feel free to ask a question or comment on my contact page!
